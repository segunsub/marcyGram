Introducing MarcyGram where users can interact with other users without worrying about their likes or followers. MarcyGram also allows users to get to know more about each other.
This product is for the Marcy Lab family to interact with each other.
## Summary ##
  > To use this product, a user must create an account or login if they have an account. Once a user has an account they are allowed to follow other users. A user can like a post by other users, post on their gram, comment on other users’ posts, edit their profile, and log out.
## Problem ##
  > Social media is highly used in our daily life and it affects how we think of ourselves. It makes us forget what’s real and what’s the reel.
## Solution ##
  > This product feature allows a user to follow other users but the number of followers is not displayed. In addition, users may like a post more than one time with a set limit of 10 likes per post. This should remove the pressure for a user to gain a large number of followers or likes on a post.
